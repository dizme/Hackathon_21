<h1>Use case description</h1>

<p>
We address the B2C challenge, proposing a solution for the customer due diligence in the banking and financial sectors. Amlet is designed to improve the relationship with customers, reducing frictions during onboarding, which today cut the conversion of online services by half. It is based on two main parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the Amlet web interface;</li>
<li>the Dizme Application.</li>
</ol>


<h1>How we built it</h1>
<p>
Amlet web interface is devoted to collect and verify personal information needed to open a bank relation. Amlet web interface uses dynamic forms, able to adapt to customers’ risk profile in real time, and it assists the customer understand what data must be shared with the bank, and why. It then asks for some paper documentation to be uploaded, usually identity documents and tax declaration, on the basis of the customer’s risk profile. This information is therefore translated into verifiable credentials and then sent to Dizme app. Every time the user wants to open a new bank account, and will need to provide her personal information, she will just scan a qrcode, to open an encrypted, p2p channel, with the financial institution. The transmission of the verifiable credentials will take just a few seconds, making customer due diligence almost instantaneous.
