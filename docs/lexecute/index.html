<h1>Use case description</h1>
<!--<i>Description of the addressed challenge and use case</i>-->
<p>Lexecute is a solution for smart legal contract lifecycle management and execution, which allows the online and automated management of a contractual relationship over its entire life cycle.</p>
<p>In a B2B configuration, it provides organizations that stipulate consumer contracts with a platform that can be used by end users (consumer customers of B2B organizations). The reference B2B markets are those that manage massive contracts: InsureTech, Fintech, Leasing, Credit, E-government etc.</p>
<p>Lexecute’s technological infrastructure allows to create an ecosystem of ancillary service providers (called “Oracles” or “Third-Party Providers”), which substantially increases the added value of the solution.</p>
<p>The B2B solution implemented addresses some critical points of contract management:</p>
<ol>
<li>onboarding of contract parties using Verifiable Credentials to get personal information and documents</li>
<li>digital signature of contracts</li>
</ol>

<h1>How we built it</h1>
<p>The integration between Lexecute and Dizme is realized by adding 2 new software components to the Lexecute architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>a web application to guide users through the onboarding process</li>
<li>a microservice that provides the access interface to the Dizme ecosystem functionalities</li>
</ol>
<p>By using Dizme, Lexecute can now quickly onboard new users with their L1 verifiable credentials, issue new member credentials, and digitally sign contracts.</p>
