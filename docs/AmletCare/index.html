<h1>Use case description</h1>

<p>
We address the G2C challenge, proposing a decentralized solution for the implementation of the so-called “Digital green certificate” proposed by the European Commission, or of any other similar initiative conceived to reduce the spreading of the Covid-19.  Following the Digital green certificate, we are able to transform in verifiable credentials these information about the holder:
</p>
<ul>
<li>having been vaccinated against COVID-19;</li>
<li>having received a negative test result;</li>
<li>having recovered from COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amlet Care consists of two parts working in close connection:</p>

<ol>
<li>the Amlet web interface;</li>
<li>the Dizme Application.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Amlet Care solution enables the commercial-grade implementation of SafeTogether Shielding use case  developed by our team and presented at CovidCreds.org initiative. Our system supports the management of a “buffer” with immune persons, according to the proposal of Prof. Udi Shapiro from the Weizmann Institute.  Amelt Care supports staff for high-risk categories, it enables to verify directly the truthfulness and validity of the certificate, avoiding the risk of fraud.

<h1>How we built it</h1>
<p>
Amlet web interface is devoted to collect and verify personal information. The citizen authenticates herself using Dizme identity data, then Amlet web interface uses dynamic forms to ask the citizen which information about her health status she wants to transform in verifiable credentials. It then asks for some paper documentation to be uploaded, usually a vaccination certificate or the result of a swab, in a pdf form. The certificates are checked in order to avoid frauds (and verifying they concern the right person), then OCR software extracts all the needed information. This information is therefore translated into verifiable credentials and sent to the Dizme app. Every time the citizen needs to prove her health status, she will just scan a qrcode, to open an encrypted, p2p channel, with the verifier (being it a policeman, a hostess, a restaurateur, depending on the country's policy). The transmission of the verifiable credentials will take just a few seconds, making health checks almost instantaneous and allowing safe travels or safe events’ attending.
