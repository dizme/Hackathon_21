<h1>Use case description</h1>

<p>
Premise: Gaya is a web and mobile application to help professionals and companies to sign legally-binding agreements instantly
and securely, from anywhere in the world, using a built-in video conferencing system integrated with electronic
signature.</p>
<p>
Gaya iss designed to support vertical markets and one of the first to be developed is the Real Estate One, providing RE Agenvies with the ability to legally managed all the signing workflows in a property trade.</p>
<p>Our B2C solution addresses several points of friction in the typical user story of a Real Estate trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>onBoarding of Sellers and Buyers by the RE Agency</li>
<li>Upload and verification of personal information and documents</li>
<li>remote digital signature of documents and contracts</li>
<li>standard modeling of the Real Estate property relevant information (IFC, BIM, BEM)</li>
<li>Portanility of credential and NFT and ability to share them with urther stakeholder (Bank, Intermediaries, etc.)</li>
<li>Setting up the basis for a regulated Real Estate Tokenisation </li>
</ol>


<h1>How we built it</h1>
<p>
We forked Gaya Platform (which is currently undergoing an intense development sprint, trying to go in production by july '21) and we cloned the demo environment available at. https://demo.gayadeed.it</p>
<p>we set up the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li>a set of proof template on our Dizme environment both for onboarding and for the real estate property modelling</li>
<li>we realised an additional back end compnent for Gaya, building the SSI onboarding fast lane leveraging a L1 verified credential</li>
<li>we modeled the the Real Estate property relevant information as a metadata file, sored on IPFS and referenced in the NFT</li>
<li>we developed a dAPP, acting as a minter of a non fungible asset on Algorand</li>
<li>We defined a new schema and clain definition for the real estate property NFT on Dizme studio</li>
</ol>
