<h1>Use case description</h1>
<p>According to Article 41 of the Italian Constitution, an employer has freedom of economic initiative, but this must be exercised in full respect of the freedom and dignity of its employees.
  The employer's power of control, therefore, finds its limits in respecting the privacy, personal dignity, freedom of expression and communication of workers.</p>
  <p>Using the SSI technological standards, employers have the capability of complete control over their employees, guaranteeing the highest levels of privacy and personal dignity. 
    Thanks to the get™ wearable device, we make it possible to integrate and use SSI and VC within the world of industry 4.0.
    get ™ implements a decentralized key management system, container of all rights within the enterprise context. 
    <br>
<h1>How we built it</h1>
<p>Deed has developed get™, a wrist wearable device that is an integral part of a highly scalable and competitive integrated hardware and software platform.</p>
<p>The device features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High security standards: dual core micro processor with crypto-only core and separate secure element (eSE) on board. This allows data encryption, decryption, secure key storage and credentials creation to be performed on the device in stand alone mode</li>
  <li>Strong user authentication: Deed is pioneering continuous user identification using ECG. Get ™ guarantees strong and continuous intra-session authentication by electric cardiac signal analysis. This represents a new security standard as ECG is unique for each subject and virtually un-clonable.</li>
  <li>Advanced biometrics: get ™ is able to detect some of the most significant biometric parameters of the user and analyze the psychophysical state of health of the subject through features with ISO and FDA certification.</li>
  <li>Bone conduction: technology used in the medical sector for decades that allows you to reproduce sounds by bone vibration and not by air</li>
  <li>Multiple communication methods: NFC, WiFi and Bluetooth 5.1 are all available on the wearable for stand-alone use as well as partner device to a cellular phone or a conputer</li>
</ul>
  Together with the wearable, our solution includes a phone app integrating the Dizme stack and an enterprise dashboard within which the employer is able to create and revoke employee verified credentials and monitor operations and accesses within the workplace in real time. In addition, thanks to the processors inside the get, the employer will also be able to monitor some vital parameters, always respecting privacy, to improve safety within the working environment.
  The system integrations will allow the generation of DIDs for the device, issuing of biometric credentials, custody of biometric and generic credentials, verification of biometric credentials and access credentials, all in seamless persistent authentication. 
The steps for software platform development are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Integration of the Dizme Stack into the get™ app to allow the generation and management of user credentials within the get app, transforming it into a DKMS (Dizme Wallet White Label)</li>
  <li>Connect the wearable get™ with the wallet, allowing the user to create VC's on the phone and store them on the wearable for direct use and persistent authentication  </li>
  <li>Enable the wearable to create its own decentralized identifier (DID) thus becoming an issuer of verifiable credentials using biometrics and other data unique to it. In industry 4.0 scenarios, get™ can become a stand alone device for the generation, custody and verification of VCs at this stage</li>
  <li>Create novel schemas (using the previous models) for the creation of VCs related to biometric data collected by the wearable</li>
 
</ol>

<h1>Market approach and follow up</h1>

  <p>In both B2B and B2C scenarios there are numerous opportunities for full implementations or integrations with existing infrastructure, both for direct user 
  or cross selling opportunities.</p>

 Further scenarios to validate the adaptability of the get ™ solution in areas such as:
 <ul> <li><b>B2C:</b>
  Smart Cities, ES: metro turnstiles, sharing services where it is necessary to authenticate the customer / user and offer a payment service;
  </li>
  <li><b>B2B:</b>
  Industry 4.0: IoT> control> security> credential> access> use / maintenance;</li>
  <li><b>Employees or business consultants:</b> authorized access control and permissions;</li>
  <li><b>Employees:</b> access to work areas, employee health monitoring in compliance with privacy regulations;</li>
 <li> <b>Banking:</b> get ™ as a hard wallet for integrating both classic and token / crypto / complementary currency payment systems.</li>
